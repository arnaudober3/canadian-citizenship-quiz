## Adding or Editing Questions

Questions live in `src/assets/questions-en.json` and `src/assets/questions-fr.json`. Each entry follows this shape:

```json
{
  "question": "What is the capital of Canada?",
  "options": ["Toronto", "Ottawa", "Vancouver", "Montreal"],
  "correctOptionIndex": 1
}
```

`correctOptionIndex` is zero-based.
